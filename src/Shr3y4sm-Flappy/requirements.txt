# Requirements for the Flappy-style GUI game
# The game uses only the Python standard library (tkinter, random, time).
# No external packages are required to run `gui_game.py`.

# If you plan to run other utilities in this folder (see `run.py`), they may
# require additional packages (example: solders, bip_utils) which are NOT
# required for the Flappy game itself.
